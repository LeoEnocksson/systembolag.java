This is code from a school project. The purpose of this project on github is to present the types of project we worked with. 
The program:
1. Search for product from the systembolag database. 
2. Filter product using diffrent parameters.
3. The program is manipulated through a GUI.
4. Purpose of the project is to be able to parse objects from a database and show it in a GUI. 

Problems:
